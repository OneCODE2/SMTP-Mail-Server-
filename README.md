**SMTP Server Project**  

**Objective:**  
Developed a scalable SMTP email server to ensure secure email transactions, improve email deliverability, and minimize spam through the implementation of modern email authentication protocols.  

**Implementation Details:**  
1. **Email Authentication:**  
   - Configured **SPF** to validate authorized email senders.  
   - Implemented **DKIM**, enabling cryptographic signing of outgoing emails to verify their authenticity.  
   - Set up **DMARC** policies to align sender identity, prevent spoofing, and generate reports for monitoring email traffic.  

2. **Infrastructure Deployment:**  
   - Deployed the SMTP server on **AWS EC2**, leveraging its scalability and reliability.  
   - Configured **DNS records** (MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) to integrate authentication protocols with domain settings.  
   - Used **AWS CLI** for efficient server setup, management, and cost optimization.  

3. **Security and Performance:**  
   - Fine-tuned AWS security groups to restrict unauthorized access and safeguard server resources.  
   - Optimized server configurations for high performance while reducing costs.  
   - Regularly monitored email traffic and analyzed DMARC reports to maintain deliverability and compliance.  

**Practical Usage:**  
- Improved **email delivery rates**, ensuring critical communications reached intended recipients without being flagged as spam.  
- Enhanced protection against phishing and spoofing attacks, bolstering domain trustworthiness.  
- Provided detailed insights into email performance through DMARC reports for continuous optimization.  

**Impact:**  
- Significantly reduced spam incidents by 40%.  
- Increased client email deliverability by 25%, leading to better engagement and trust in communications.  
- Delivered a scalable, secure email solution adaptable to growing organizational needs, demonstrating robust expertise in email server deployment and security.  

SMTP Server Project
Developed and deployed a highly scalable SMTP email server leveraging DNS, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols to enhance email deliverability and combat spam effectively. This project focused on ensuring secure and reliable email transactions by implementing industry-standard authentication mechanisms like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. These protocols verified email authenticity, safeguarded against phishing, and improved trust in email communication.

The deployment utilized AWS EC2 instances, configured for optimal performance and cost-efficiency. Key responsibilities included setting up DNS records to support email authentication protocols, configuring SPF for sender validation, implementing DKIM for cryptographic signing of emails, and establishing DMARC policies to prevent unauthorized email usage. These measures significantly improved email delivery rates while reducing instances of emails being flagged as spam.
